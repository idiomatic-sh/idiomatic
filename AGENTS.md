# Codex Instructions

Batch repairs by default. Collect the full diagnostic set, group related failures,
and fix the affected implementation, callers, and tests before the next combined
check. Parallel agents hand off cohesive batches; one integrator runs shared
checks. Do not compile after each individual fix. Use a narrow diagnostic run
only to resolve a specific uncertainty, and state why it is needed.

For architecture or performance audit findings, use the [systemic audit skill](.agents/skills/systemic-audit/SKILL.md) before claiming an implementation family is closed.
